        """Treating a fever with paracetamol and ibuprofen.\n\nIt is important to know the reason for the high temperature - such as a cold or viral illness. If you have already seen a doctor and have a diagnosis then you can manage fever and symptoms at home.

If children aren't unwell or in pain you don't have to use paracetamol or ibuprofen - but often it will bring them comfort.

Paracetamol\n
Paracetamol is a good first-line medicine to help children feel better. It is usually fine to give to anyone and in the doses stated on the bottle. For those born prematurely, you should have already been given advice on the right doses for an infection. Always check if you are unsure.

The correct dose will be according to the age group. You can only give paracetamol four times a day (a 24-hour period) and each dose has to be at least four hours apart.

Tips to keep you right:
One thing I’ve found as a parent - usually when sleep-deprived - is that I forget what I have given at what time. Recent studies have shown that parents are at risk of accidentally overdosing or underdosing their children because they forget when and how much they have given.\n

I find that writing it down helps, and I also send a text to my partner, so they are aware of what and when I am giving each medicine. For example - I gave my unwell toddler Calpol - which is a paracetamol - at 12 pm and ibuprofen at 3 pm. At 6 pm his fever was creeping up so I knew I could give him Calpol safely.\n
Using a syringe to measure doses helps to give out the exact amounts needed without wastage.\n
Loose clothing - I tend to let them run around in their underwear and a loose tee shirt. It keeps them cooler and more comfortable - avoid cold sponges and direct cooling from fans. Lowering a temperature too quickly can be problematic too.\n\n\n

    'Title': 'How is pneumonia treated?',
    'description':
        """Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung which is usually caused by an infection. Pneumonia varies a lot in severity with many people making a full recovery, but in some cases it can be life-threatening.
                  
                  
                  How to treat pneumonia
Antibiotics
Most cases of pneumonia are caused by bacterial infection which can be treated effectively with antibiotics. They can be taken as tablets, capsules, or liquids. In more severe cases of pneumonia, they may be given intravenously - IV through a drip into the veins.

The choice of antibiotic depends on how severe the pneumonia is, what type of pneumonia it is, and what types of bacteria are found in the local area - including patterns of antibiotic resistance.

In the UK, antibiotics such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin and doxycycline are often used for community-acquired pneumonia. Co-amoxiclav can be used as second-line - if the first antibiotic does not work - or if the pneumonia is associated with aspiration. Different antibiotics are used to treat hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia because those conditions are caused by different bacteria which require other drugs.

Antivirals
These medicines can be used for viral pneumonia, depending on the exact virus that is causing the infection. Examples include oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) for the flu (influenza) virus and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

Oxygen
If pneumonia causes oxygen levels in the blood to drop, extra oxygen can be given. This can be given through oxygen masks or small tubes that sit just inside the nose. This needs to be given in hospital.

Fluids
If people are dehydrated or have signs of sepsis, fluids can be given using a drip for hydration, and to treat dangerously low blood pressure. These need to be given in hospital.

Painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen
Paracetamol or ibuprofen can treat symptoms of pain and fever from pneumonia.

Breathing support - ventilation
Sometimes, in severe cases of pneumonia, the lungs become badly affected and can't get enough oxygen into the body. In these cases, breathing machines (ventilators) can be used to support the lungs. These include breathing masks that are used to support breathing whilst awake (non-invasive ventilation) and ventilation using a breathing tube on a ventilator - whilst unconscious. Breathing support is given in special hospital wards, called high-dependency units or intensive care units. Generally, those admitted into these units are very unwell.

Chest physiotherapy
Chest physiotherapy, from specialist therapists, can help treat the symptoms of pneumonia and may improve recovery.

    'Title': 'Could it be gallstones?',
    'description': """What are gallstones?
Gallstones form in your gallbladder. This small pear-shaped pouch, just 8 cm long, sits tucked away under your liver, on the upper right side of your tummy. It acts as a storage pouch for a yellow-greenish liquid called bile, produced by your liver. Bile has two main functions - breaking down food (especially fatty food) you've eaten and carrying away waste from your liver.

When you eat, your stomach produces a hormone which stimulates the muscles in the wall of the gallbladder. These contract and release bile, which passes down a tube called the bile duct connecting your gallbladder to your intestine. Here it gets to work digesting fat, allowing it to be absorbed from your gut into your bloodstream.

But bile contains several substances, including bile salts, the pigment bilirubin and cholesterol. If there's an imbalance in the amount of any of these , tiny stone-like deposits can form-gallstones. Then these gallstones can gradually increase in size.

Gallstones treatment
Treatment for gallstones depends on the complications they have caused. Only a few people with gallstones, who have never had problems, develop complications each year. When treating gallstones, your doctor is likely to recommend that you try and lose excess weight - while avoiding crash diets or rapid weight loss - and leave them alone unless you get pain. The same may apply if you just have mild, infrequent pain.

If you have acute cholecystitis or biliary colic, you may need admission to hospital for strong pain relief and antibiotics if there's also an infection. After this, you should be offered surgery to remove your gallbladder - known as a cholecystectomy- you can lead a perfectly normal life without one. These days, most people can have keyhole surgery under general anaesthetic. They can usually go home the same day, with full recovery within a couple of weeks.

After a gallbladder removal, some people may need to avoid spicy or fatty foods to prevent bloating or diarrhoea.

    'Title': 'Why going bald can seriously affect your mental health',
    'description':
        """Most men begin to notice thinning hair or a receding hairline in their 20s. But although male hair loss is incredibly common, it can still be very distressing and negatively affect self-esteem. Dr Max Pemberton explores the psychological impact of balding and what to do if you're losing your confidence along with your tresses.
    By the age of 50, half of all men will have noticeable hair loss. By the age of 60, it will affect around two thirds. The majority of men, therefore, will at some point in their life, have hair loss.

It's so common, in fact, going bald could be considered a normal part of being male. It's actually more unusual not to go bald. Yet despite how common male pattern baldness is, it causes untold distress and anguish to men. It's strongly associated with the development of depression, anxiety and poor self-image.
many men are able to embrace their thinning hair. Just look at Bruce Willis and Jason Statham. Some guys adopt a close-shaved look and frame it in terms of evidence of their masculinity and manliness. Good for them. For those who struggle to accept the change and lament their hair loss, there is a multi-billion pound industry that, I'm sorry to say, promises a lot but tends not to deliver.

There is no magic pill or miracle surgery to reverse hair loss. Even finasteride only actually causes re-growth of hair in a small number of people who take it, with it simply slowing the rate of loss for most. It only provides about 30% improvement in hair loss over six months. Hair grafts and transplants have limitations and are very costly with results varying considerably. Shampoos and lotions and potions have limited - if any - effect.

That's why I often recommend men who are struggling with going bald see a clinical psychologist to have a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to address their distress and help them to change their thinking about their hair loss. It sounds unlikely, but it really does work.

The fact is, it is much easier - and cheaper - to learn to accept the hair loss than it is to reverse it.

    'Title': 'What is prostate cancer?',
    'description':
        '''Prostate cancer is a cancer which develops from cells in the prostate gland. It is the most common cancer in men in the UK. Each year, about 52,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK. It affects about 1 in 8 men in the UK at some point in their lives. Most cases develop in men over the age of 75 years.

Prostate cancer is often slow-growing, does not reduce life expectancy, and may not need treatment. In some cases it is more aggressive, spreads to other parts of the body and may benefit from treatment. In general, the more advanced the cancer (the more it has grown and spread), the less chance that treatment will be curative. However, treatment can often slow the progress of the cancer.
Prostate cancer causes
Although the exact cause is unclear, certain risk factors increase the chance that prostate cancer may develop. These include:

Ageing. Most cases occur in older men.
Family history and genetic factors. If your father or brother had prostate cancer at a relatively early age (before the age of 60 years) then you have an increased risk. Also, if the type of breast cancer which is linked to a faulty gene runs in your female relatives then you are at increased risk of prostate cancer. These factors point towards a faulty gene which may occur in some men.
Ethnic group. Prostate cancer is more common in African-Caribbean men and less common in Asian men.
Obesity is a risk factor for advanced prostate cancer.
Diet is possibly a risk factor. As with other cancers, a diet high in fats and low in fruit and vegetables may increase the risk.
Exposure to the metal cadmium may be a risk.

    'description':
        """Do you know how old your heart is? The obvious answer, of course, is 'As old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth' - but it's not that kind of age I'm talking about. You can turn back the clock on heart attack risks by improving your lifestyle.
    Obviously, your age (the one on your birth certificate!) affects your risk of heart disease, and try as we'd like, we can't change that. So does your gender - women don't suffer heart attacks as often as men do, but there's no room for complacency. In fact, 68,000 women in the UK have a heart attack every year, compared to 120,000 men. But let's look at all the ways you can improve your risks
    Stop smoking
One of them is right under your nose (and that of everyone else within sniffing distance of you) - smoking.

Stopping smoking is probably the single biggest favour you can do your body, and while it may not be easy, there has never been more support. You can find out about local NHS services by phoning free on 0300 123 1044 in England, 0800 84 84 84 in Scotland or 0800 085 2219 in Wales. Alternatively, PHE's support includes a free personal quit plan.

It's often as simple as making an appointment with a local pharmacist, who can offer advice and smoking cessation aids such as nicotine replacement or the medication varenicline. You're far more likely to quit successfully by using a combination of support and smoking cessation aids (including vaping) than with willpower alone.

Amazingly, levels are now down from a peak of 45% of adults smoking to 17% of men and 13% of women today - you could join them!

Get active
The benefits of regular exercise are pretty much endless - in addition to strengthening your heart and cutting your risk of both heart attack and stroke, weight-bearing exercise cuts your risk of osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) and can boost your mood and reduce your risk of depression.

The key from your heart's perspective is aerobic exercise - the kind that gets your heart pumping and makes you mildly out of puff. PHE recommends about 150 minutes a week - that's equivalent to half an hour five times a week. For years, 'standard' advice has recommended that people aim for 10,000 steps a day. But, in fact, doing that much or more may not help your heart much; it's all done at gentle strolling pace, while less can do great things for your heart if it's intense enough to get heart and pulse rate up.

That's where PHE initiatives such as Active 10 and or the Couch to 5k app come in. You don't need to deck yourself out in lycra or pay a fortune for a gym - they can help you incorporate activity easily into your day-to-day routine

Check your blood pressure
High blood pressure is right up there at the top of the list too, where risk factors are concerned. It's also probably the single biggest risk factor for stroke. You won't know you've got high blood pressure unless you have it checked - except in very rare situations, high blood pressure doesn't cause short-term symptoms, but it puts a huge strain on your heart.

High blood pressure can be effectively controlled in the vast majority with daily medication - but clearly, you need to keep taking the tablets and have your blood pressure checked regularly. Cutting the salt in your diet also goes a long way to reducing your blood pressure.

    'Title': 'High Blood Pressure',
    'description':
        """High blood pressure (hypertension) happens when the force on the walls of blood vessels (caused by the blood within them) is more than normal. This means the heart has to work harder and the blood vessels are under more strain, making it a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and other serious conditions.
    What is blood pressure?
Your blood pressure reading will have two figures, one 'over' the other - for example, 140/80. The higher figure (called the systolic level) is a measure of the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is pumping blood out. The lower figure (called the diastolic level) is a measure of the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is resting between heartbeats. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mm Hg).

A one-off blood pressure reading that is high does not mean that you have high blood pressure. Your blood pressure varies throughout the day. It may be high for a short time if you are anxious, stressed, or have just been exercising.

What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?
The vast majority of people with high blood pressure do not know they have it, until it causes a complication such as a stroke or heart attack. Usually high blood pressure is only picked up if blood pressure is checked routinely, or as part of checks for another medical problem.

Occasionally if blood pressure is very high, you can get headaches. Even more occasionally, some people feel a bit dizzy, or their vision can be affected by high blood pressure.

Other than the blood pressure reading being high, there isn't usually anything for the doctor to find on examination either. If blood pressure has been high for some time, or very high, there can be changes in the blood vessels at the back of the eye.

How is high blood pressure diagnosed?
You have high blood pressure if you have several blood pressure readings that are high, taken on different occasions, and when you are relaxed.

High blood pressure (hypertension) is a blood pressure that is 140/90 mm Hg or above each time it is taken at the GP surgery, or home or ambulatory readings where the average is more than 135/85 mm Hg. That is, it is sustained at this level.

Unless a single level is extremely high, your doctor will not make a diagnosis of high blood pressure without an average of several readings, usually from home or ambulatory measurements. Blood pressure recording outside of the doctor's surgery is recommended in most people who are suspected of having high blood pressure.

One reason for this is because some people become anxious in medical clinics. This can cause the blood pressure to rise. (This is often called white coat hypertension.) Home or ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure may show that the blood pressure is normal when you are relaxed.

However, if you have diabetes, or have recently had a heart attack or stroke, you may be advised to have blood pressure checks fairly often over the following week or so. Also, treatment with medication is usually considered at an earlier stage if the high blood pressure readings remain high.

Treatments for high blood pressure
As you can see in our leaflet on home and ambulatory blood pressure, doctors rarely treat high blood pressure on the basis of a single reading. Instead, guidelines suggest they should check your average blood pressure at home or using a machine you wear for 24 hours to measure your 'ambulatory blood pressure'.

It is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that medication to help control high blood pressure should be used in addition to lifestyle advice for persistent stage 2 hypertension (clinic blood pressure measured as 160/100 mm Hg or higher but less than 180/120 mm Hg and home or anbulatory blood pressure average of 150/95 mm Hg or higher).

You might also be advised to start taking medication if you are aged under 80 with persistent stage 1 hypertension (clinic blood pressure between 140/90 mm Hg and 159/99 mm Hg and home or ambulatory blood pressure average of 135/85 mm Hg to 149/94 mm Hg) if it is found that the high blood pressure has caused any damage, such as to your eyes, heart or kidneys, or if you also have known cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or if it is found that you have a 10 year risk of a heart attack or stroke of above 10%.

Medication may be considered in addition to lifestyle advice if you are aged under 60 with stage 1 hypertension.

Medication may also be considered in addition to lifestyle advice if you are aged over 80 with stage 1 hypertension if your clinic blood pressure is over 150/90 mm Hg.

If you have 'grade 1 hypertension' clinic blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg to 159/99 mm Hg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average blood pressure 135/85 mm Hg to 149/94 mm Hg - blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg in clinic or average blood pressure of 135/85 mm Hg, doctors will check your 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke. This takes into account several factors including your age, gender, cholesterol levels and other medical conditions, as well as your blood pressure.

NICE recommends starting treatment if your 10-year risk is over 10%. That means many more people may be offered tablets to protect them against heart attack and stroke.

There are many different medicines for high blood pressure. They work in various different ways. Your doctor will advise on the best one for you. If it doesn't work, or you have side-effects, there are plenty of other options. The idea is to find you one or more pills which suit you, and which control your blood pressure. Once you and your doctor have cracked it, you'll need to keep taking your medication long-term to make sure you stay protected. Your blood pressure will be checked regularly and medication adjusted if need be.

    'Title': 'Electrocardiogram',
    'description':
        """An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart. The heart produces tiny electrical impulses which spread through the heart muscle to make the heart contract. These impulses can be detected by the ECG machine. You may have an ECG to help find the cause of symptoms such as the feeling of a 'thumping heart' (palpitations) or chest pain. Sometimes it is done as part of routine tests - for example, before you have an operation.

The ECG test is painless and harmless. (The ECG machine records electrical impulses coming from your body - it does not put any electricity into your body.)

What does an electrocardiogram (ECG) show?
The electrodes placed on the different parts of the body detect electrical impulses coming from different directions within the heart. There are normal patterns for each electrode. Various heart disorders produce abnormal patterns. The heart disorders that can be detected include:

Abnormal heart rhythms. If the heart rate is very fast, very slow, or irregular. There are various types of irregular heart rhythm with characteristic ECG patterns.
A heart attack (myocardial infarction) and if it was recent or some time ago. A heart attack causes damage to heart muscle and it heals with scar tissue. These can be detected by abnormal ECG patterns.
An enlarged heart. Basically, this causes bigger impulses than normal.
What does a normal ECG look like?
When reviewing an ECG, the healthcare professional will look at several different aspects.

These include the rate (how fast the heart is beating), the rhythm (whether the heartbeat is regular or irregular), the cardiac axis (direction of electrical spread within the heart), and an analysis of the different parts of the electrical wave.

The points of interest may vary depending on the reason for an ECG - for example, a doctor reviewing an ECG done in the emergency department for acute chest pain will be looking for signs of a heart attack. In contrast, for a routine ECG arranged by a GP who has noticed an irregular heartbeat, they may be particularly looking for an irregularity and absent P waves. These are a sign of atrial fibrillation, a common cause of heartbeat irregularities.

In recent years we have become more aware of the importance of the QT interval, the distance between two parts of the electrical wave. Some drugs should not be used if the patient has a prolonged QT inverval and therefore this will usually be looked at when interpreting an ECG.

How is an ECG done?
Small metal electrodes are stuck on to your chest. Wires from the electrodes are connected to the ECG machine. The machine detects and amplifies the electrical impulses that occur at each heartbeat and records them on to a paper or computer. A few heartbeats are recorded from different sets of electrodes.

How long does an ECG take?
The test takes about five minutes to do. Sometimes a small ECG machine can be worn for prolonged periods to see whether you have an irregular heart rhythm. This is called an ambulatory electrocardiogram.

Is an ECG result always accurate

Any test can have a false positive, or false negative result done. It is crucial that an ECG is read by a professional who has the skills to do so, so that they can interpret the trace in conjunction with the clinical history and examination. Some changes will have a significant impact on the need for future tests, or treatment, whereas others will be less important.
